## QML Box2D plugin

The goal is to expose the functionality of Box2D as QML components, in order
to make it easy to write physics based games in QML.

This plugin is meant to be installed to your Qt/imports directory, or shipped
in a directory of which the parent is added as import path.

### INSTALLING


 qmake
 make
 make install  (goes to Qt's import path, run with sudo if necessary)


### RUNNING THE EXAMPLES

 You can run the examples launcher with:
 qmlscene examples/ui.qml
 (You need to be in the root folder of qml-box2d.)

 [examples](examples/examples.md)


### DEPLOYMENT

The standart plugin (dynamically linked) runs well on Mac, Window and Linux.
The qml-box2d plugin can be linked statically to run on both iOS and Android.


### USING QT CREATOR

For running you can use a "Custom Executable" configuration set to run
"qmlscene" with the right parameters.

When you have write permissions to Qt's import path, it can be convenient to
add a deployment step to your run settings:

 * Go to Projects -> box2d -> Run Settings
 * Choose Add Deploy Step -> Make
 * Enter "install" under "Make arguments"

This will make sure that before running, the version of the plugin is updated
in Qt's import path.
